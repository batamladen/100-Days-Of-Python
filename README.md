# 100 Days of Code - Python
## Overview
Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge! This repository documents my journey as I commit to coding in Python for 100 consecutive days. Each day, I will post my progress, including the goal of the specific day as well as the code of the project.

Hopefully this repo is of use to someone else as well.

## Goals
* Improve my Python programming skills.
* Document my progress and share it with the community.
* Build a useful daily habbit for the summer.

## Structure
The repository is organized by day. Each folder corresponds to a specific day and contains all the code and resources related to that day's challenge.

## Pull
Feel free to send pull requests, I am aware that the projects can be done better, shorther, added a few more functions. Send your pull requests, I love them!
